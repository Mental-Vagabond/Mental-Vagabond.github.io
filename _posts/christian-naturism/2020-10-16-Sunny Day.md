When I first started thinking of myself as a naturist, I ran across the webpage of Sunny Day.  She is another Christian Naturist who discovered the link between nudity, spirituality and a oneness with nature and God.  Unlike me, she admitted it to herself early in life, lived her life according to this truth, and is raising her children in this truth.  She's posted less and less as she has gotten older, finished college, started her career, gotten married, and become a mother.  Looking at her past posts encouraged me, and made me feel like I wasn't wierd or alone.

I've added an "ad" on the sidebar that links to her website.  I hope you enjoy the site as much as I have.
