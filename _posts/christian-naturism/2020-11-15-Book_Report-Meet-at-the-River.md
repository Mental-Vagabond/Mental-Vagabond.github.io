### _Meeting at the River: A Tale of Naked Truth_ 
#### by David L. Hutton

I saw many things in the Bible when I was in my teens that made me start questioning the doctrine of my church.  But I was convinced by my Mother, Preachers, Sunday school teachers, and eventually my wife, that I was wrong.  I continued to have the feelings that I would rather be naked, but I had been taught by our society that this was sinful, so I lived my life with these feelings of shame until I found that I was not the only person who saw the same thing in the Bible.

This book is a Biblical study of the topic of the human body, and what the Bible really says about these topics, and not the societal mores that are preached, and the Bible twisted to try to justify them.  

David Hutton shows us through well written prose a glimpse of what the life of a first-century Christian would have been like, then backs it up with the Bible.  It really opened my eyes and convinced me even more that I was correct.

I hope one day, the opinions expressed in this book will become more widely accepted, and our society will become less oppressive to nudity.
