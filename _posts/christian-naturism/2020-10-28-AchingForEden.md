I recently ran across this Christian Naturism blog.  It is written by a Christian Naturist couple who, like me, came to this life later in life.  I really appreciate their writings.  I am especially appreciative of "the Mrs" and her point of view.  One of my favorite pages on their site is the "Memes" page.   I'm glad that more and more Christian Nudists are willing to speak out.

I've had an "ad" on the sidebar that links to this website since the beginning of my blog.  I hope you enjoy the site as much as I have.

### About the Photo:
I took this panorama photo (top of page) with my Sony mirrorless a6500 camera at Baker's clothing optional beach in San Francisco, California.
