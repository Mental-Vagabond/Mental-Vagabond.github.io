I haven't blogged for a while, I've still been spending a lot of time working on my Google MyMap of Naturist places.  I posted it on several naturst/nudist subreddits and gotten a lot of good feedback.  The number of beaches, resorts, etc listed on the map have grown a lot since I last posted here.

What I came here to talk about is that I've finally joined a national Christian naturist organization, CNA, the [Christian Naturists of America](https://christiannaturistsofamerica.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}.  I'm attending their [annual conference](https://christiannaturistsofamerica.wordpress.com/2021/05/24/chapel-at-oaklake-trails-july-3-5/){:target="_blank"}at Oak Lake Trails Naturist Resort in central Oklahoma.  I'm excited to go.  It's been a while for me. 

I hope to see you there!



### About the Photo:
I took this panorama photo (top of page) in Arches National Park in Eastern Utah.  I always marvel at the artestry, as well as the power of our God.
