  text: "This is the question that I'm asked most often when people find out that I'm both a Christian and a Naturist.  Is Christianity opposed to nudity or nudism?  Come study the Bible with me and find out what it says about being naked"

  text: "There are many places in the Bible where people who are nude are mentioned.  Many of the verses we've heard preached to us from the pulpit with a negative spin, and in our nudity phobic society, we rarely hear anything positive about nakedness.  Here are what I could find.  Let's read through them."

### Abut the Photo: 
The photo at the top of this page was taken by me at Black's Beach in San Diego, California.  I took it from the southern border of the clothing optional section pointing north showing a large portion of that section.  I took it with my Sony a6500 mirrorless camera.
