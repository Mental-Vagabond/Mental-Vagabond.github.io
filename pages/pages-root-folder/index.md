  text: "There are many places in the Bible where people who are nude are mentioned.  Many of the verses we've heard preached to us from the pulpit with a negative spin, and in our nudity phobic society, we rarely hear anything positive about nakedness.  Here are what I could find.  Let's read through them."

# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss
