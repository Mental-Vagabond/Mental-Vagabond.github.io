#### *Senvestulo* 
Esperanto for "Person without clothing" is how I think of myself.  My mother told me once that I was the child that she could never keep clothed.  I would strip off my clothing and run around in the yard naked with her chasing me around the yard trying to get clothing back on me. I grew up poor, and my clothing always set me apart from the *"in crowd"*. As a child I loved to go out into the woods on the family farm, and strip off my trappings of civilization and feel nature around me.  I long for that again, but it's illegal in most places in the U.S. unless you own a large private plot of land. Maybe I'll retire to the countryside with a private piece of land of my own.  I hope you enjoy reading my thoughts. 

*The thoughts in these pages are strictly my own, most of the photographs are mine too.*

Yours sincerely, 
### *Senvestulo*
